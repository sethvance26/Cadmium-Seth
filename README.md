```md
GIVEN a React art events site:
WHEN I visit the site for the first time,
THEN I am presented with the landing page, which presents me with the options to login or create an account.
WHEN I choose to create an account,
THEN I am prompted to create a username and password and enter an email address.
WHEN I click on the login button,
THEN my user credentials are saved and I am logged into the site.
WHEN I revisit the site at a later time and choose to sign in,
THEN I am prompted to enter my username and password.
WHEN I am signed in to the site,
THEN I see navigation links for the events page, the add event page, and the logout button.
WHEN I click on the homepage option in the navigation,
THEN I am taken to the homepage and presented with existing art events that include the event title, date, time, venue name, venue address, brief description, potentially an image related to the specific event, and potentially a link to the event.
WHEN I click on the create an event option in the navigation,
THEN I am taken to the add event page and presented with the option to add a new event.
WHEN I click on the button to add a new art event,
THEN I am prompted to enter the event title, date, time, venue name, venue address, brief description, an image link related to the specific event (if I have one), and a link to the event (if I have one).
WHEN I click on the button to create a new event,
THEN the event title, date, time, venue name, venue address, brief description, and respective links are saved, and I am taken back to the homepage with my new event added at the bottom of the list.
WHEN I click on the logout option in the navigation,
THEN I am signed out of the site.
WHEN I am idle on the site for more than a set time,
THEN I am prompted to log in again before I can view events.
